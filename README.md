An automated prayer call alarm system for UNIX-like systems

> Note: This is alpha quality software and is expected to receive heavy updates in the coming weeks, InshaAllah. The implementation works on my test hardware and software, and though support for more setups would come soon, please feel free to contribute in order to make it more usable.

## Background

(coming soon...)

## Installation

There are a few different ways to get *daily-prayers*.

### Compile from source

    # Clone project to the local workspace
    git clone https://github.com/myTerminal/daily-prayers.git

    # Switch to the project directory
    cd daily-prayers

    # Install with `make`
    make install

### Automatic installation

Simply execute the below command in a terminal and the rest should be automatic.

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myTerminal/daily-prayers/main/install)"

### Through a package manager

*daily-prayers* will soon be available to install from your operating system's package manager.

## How to Use

Once installed, *daily-prayers* works automatically:

1. It fetches the prayer timings for the day once during the start of the day and sets reminders
2. At the prayer times it sets by itself, it plays an audio version of the appropriate Adhan

The following parameters have been hard-coded for the time-being and will be made configurable soon:

1. **Prayer time calculation method** has been set to "Islamic Society of North America"
2. **School** has been set to "Hanafi"

### Configuring for your location (automatic)

    daily-prayers-configure

The above command prompts user for geographical co-ordinates to be used for Adhan reminders.

### Setting alarms for current day (automatic)

    daily-prayers-set-alarms

The above command sets Adhan reminders.
